# PyEVPowerKit
Python Electric Vehicle Power Toolkit (PyEVPowerKit) is a Python toolkit designed for engineers and enthusiasts to 
facilitate the design and analysis of electrical power-trains for electric vehicles (EVs). The toolkit implements a
mechanical vehicle model considering all source acting on the vehicle while driving as well as the power train of the 
electric vehicle. It calculates the mechanical, electrical, and thermal loads on the different components of the drive-train
of the vehicle. Additionally, the thermal stress on the different components is evaluated.


# Dependencies
The requirements of the PyEVPowerKit toolkit are summarized in the requirements.txt data file. In detail, the PyEVPowerKit
Toolkit was implemented using the following dependencies:
- Python 3.11
- pandas 2.2.1
- scipy 1.12.0
- numpy
- matplotlib


# Citation 
The symbolic MTPA/MPTV solver has been abstracted from [2].


# Limitations
Since the toolkit is still under development there are several things that need to be improved, are not yet implemented 
or lack verification. In the following a list of known issues and limitations is provided:
- The numerical MTPA and MTPV solver for the IMPSM is corrupted
- SSM and ASM machine types are not yet implemented

# Architecture
The presented architecture includes a physical vehicle simulation considering all forces acting on the vehicle. In detail,
these forces including: air friction (Fa), rolling friction (Fr), climbing forces (Fc), and acceleration forces (Facc).
The total force (Ft) is then calculated as the sum of these forces.

$F_{t} = F_{a} + F_{r} + F_{c} + F_{acc}$     (1)

In detail, each of these forces can be described using the laws of physics:

$F_{a} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho_{A} \dot A \cdot c_{w} \dot v^2$     (2)
$F_{r} = c_{r} \cdot m \cdot g \cdot cos(\alpha)$     (3)
$F_{c} = m \cdot g \cdot sin(\alpha)$     (4)
$F_{acc} = (m + m_{acc}) \cdot \frac{dv}{dt}$     (5)

# Results
The results provided in this section have been obtained from a Tesla model 3 [1]. In detail, the acceleration to the 
maximum vehicle speed and the WLTP operation are considered. The parameters and the results are listed below.

# Development
As failure and mistakes are inextricably linked to human nature, the toolkit is obviously not perfect, 
thus suggestions and constructive feedback are always welcome. If you want to contribute to the PyDTS
toolkit or spot any mistake, please contact me via: p.schirmer@herts.ac.uk
